# Image-Classifier
Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

In this project, i trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice i trained this classifier, then export it for use in my application. I used the dataset from Oxford of 102 flower categories.

When i completed this project, i had an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. Here my network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application.
